#Best practices
If you're starting out a brand new project, it's easy to begin in an organized way. However, many of us
inherit data that's organized in idiosyncratic ways that may work for the creator, but might not fit into
your organization style, or aren't arranged in a way that public databases like NCBI will accept. 

We've compiled a list of common data issues, and some suggestions for Good, Better and Best practices. If you're
begining with all new data, we suggest you try for Best in each instance, but also offer suggestions for improving
the organization of legacy data to get it into public database formats.

###Naming standards
Each of your samples should have a unique identifier, and a set of standardized metadata.

####Good
Add a column to your dataset starting with MyLab1, MyLab2...MyLabN, so each sample gets a unique ID

####Better


####Best

The Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) was formed in 2011 with the principal aim of making high-quality well-documented and vouchered collections that store DNA or tissue samples of biodiversity, discoverable for research through a networked community of biodiversity repositories. This is achieved through the GGBN Data Portal (http://data.ggbn.org), which links globally distributed databases and bridges the gap between biodiversity repositories, sequence databases and research results.

If you are organizing a project from the beginning, please look at the following resources for guidance on such topics as
* data quality control, 
* data protection,
* data backup, 
* how to write quality metadata,
* analysis and workflows, and 
* data citation (get your data sets cited! not just your papers).
