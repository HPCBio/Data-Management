#### Goals
* Introduce the concept of data standards, and specifically in this case, data standards for genomics data.
* Using this introduction, reinforce the concept of planning for data and metadata capture before starting a project.
* Using this exercise, stimulate a conversation about other relevant standards and how to find them.
* Reinforce the concept of using these standards, and good metadata when inheriting work begun by others, or merging datasets.
* This exercise is also an easy way to start a discussion about the longevity of a given dataset.

#### Objectives
1. Given the following image as a printed handout, students mark (circle, highlight) terms they recognize. ![the labels handout](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2990155/6986653/689377b4-da0d-11e4-9272-e7c45a4b465b.png) Depending on the students and their current level of education, some will have more familiarity with these terms than others.
  * Once recognized terms are marked, share / compare with your neighbors, report back on any new terms / unfamiliar terms.
3. Have students share what term is used in their lab for any given term on this label hand out.
  * Discuss what would happen if you tried to merge datasets with different column headers (labels) for the same data.
  * How much time would it take? Would mistakes in "mapping" occur? Would data have to be scrapped because no one can figure
  what it means for certain?
4. Discuss the difference between two scenarios
  * starting from scratch with a collaborative team, deciding on what data and metadata to collect, vs.
  * starting up by inheriting someone else's dataset/s or merging datasets. What are the challenges? pitfalls?
5. What kind of documentation do you need to keep track of genomics projects?
6. Show how genomics (and other) data standards can help with data and metadata organization and documentation.
  * If you have an example, show how lack of standard use of terms created a problem for a specific research project.
