Learning Objectives:
-------------------

#### What's the motiviation for this lesson?
* Equip learners with knowledge and skills to organize and access data so that they and their colleagues can use it
* Keeping you data accessible to you. Sequencing centers don't keep the data (for example), and you might need to redo analysis.
* Keep track of your analysis. In two months, you won't remember what you did with your data.
* Sharing with collaborators is less fraught with anxiety that you're giving them the right version or the clean version
* When you go to publish your paper, you have your data ready to put in the data repository
* Journals and databases are requiring this information
* Makes you feel happy 

#### What mindset change should the learner have? (ie, awareness of certain techniques)

* Time spent organizing data is time that should be valued https://xkcd.com/1205/
* Value data organization   
* Good data organization saves you time
* Preventative data care
* The computer is a tool that you're doing experiments with - you can think about the data analysis as a fundamental part of the experiment and should extend the same good practices 

#### What skills should the learner leave the room w/?
* How to set up their computational environmental for the types of experiments you're going to do
* metadata organization in spreadsheets. For example, keep a master list of genomic data
* Awareness of metadata standards (where is that info). What minimal information do you need
* Management of raw data files, including:
  * Good naming schemes with unique names
  * No spaces or non-normal characters
  * Backed up
  * Accessible to lab mates
  * Don't mess with raw data files
* Knowing levels of data backup
* Knowing places where you can put your data
* management of analysis files
* Documenting your steps / data exploration (this could be incorporated in to data wrangling)
  * What you did and why


#### What would be an exercise:

* Paired exercise - each of you do an analysis, then swap and see if you can reproduce it.
* Paired exercise - work with a partner to develop the beginnings of a scheme for organizing and storing your datasets (each attendee probably has a general project plan, a partner could be a good sounding board for developing an organizational structure for data)
* Organize the data related with the test data set *E. coli* from [Patric] (http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Home). This can be used as a test example. This can be done in collaboration with a lab partner, where you can try to reproduce, understand the data generated.


#### What are the pre-reqs
* Knowing what kind of data you'll be dealing with
* Knowing what kinds of things you need to keep track of for your experiments, what do people in your field care about
vocabulary:
  * what are different levels of backups
  * metadata
  * what do we mean by raw data

#### Other comments

##### Recommendations (good, better, best)
* meaningful file names
* README files
* automated backups
* pass 'leaving academia forever' test
